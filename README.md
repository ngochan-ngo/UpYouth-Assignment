# UpYouth Homepage Replica

This project replicates the UpYouth homepage as closely as possible using HTML and CSS. It was created as a take-home challenge for a front-end developer position at UpYouth.


## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS


## Live Demo:
https://ngochan-ngo.github.io/UpYouth-Assignment


## Known Considerations:
Due to a limited development timeframe and capability, some sections and interactive elements from the original homepage are not included.


## Project Structure:
* index.html: The main HTML file containing the homepage content.
* styles.css: The CSS file containing the styles for the homepage.
* photos: The folder containing images used on the replica.


## Future Development:
A more polished version with additional features will be updated soon.


## Note:
As of the time I developed this, I only knew HTML and CSS, so this project is entirely written in these languages. Therefore, I have to admit that I really struggled to develop this, but at the same time, I also enjoyed the process and realized the steep learning curve.
